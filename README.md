# Booking
Booking project
This project was about a booking, It could be for Hostel/Hotel. So the main idea of making this this project is there could be mutiple rooms.
Like I did in that project Male, Female, Single or Double.
But after any person select their gender Accomodation type system should remove the opposite genders door from the list.

main/py is used for fronted and backend.py is used for backend.
The others are used for mapping the project.

I comment out some code In backend cause otherwise it will create database agaian and again.

As now to make the project simple. Number of Male dorm  and Female dorm is 4, single room 2 and double room is 1.

As soon as any room is booked that room will be reduce from the database. And shows "Booking was done successfully".
Other wise it will show the messeage "This room is fully booked".So that user can select other kind of room.

User can close the application by clicking "Quit Application" option.
And see the previous bookings by clicking "View All Entries"
After we can select any entries for these list and delete that entry from the list as well.

I added some screenshots in github as well where I showed the steps will occur after booking a dorm.

In first screenshot I showed the quntity of database for each dorm.
Second screenshot is about booking and third one is about entry the booking in database.
In fourth screenshot I showed the reduction of the quntity for that room.
In next screenshot I showed If I try to add another entry if the room is fully booked it will show one message to the user.

But if I select other type of dorm it will be booked and added in the database as well.
